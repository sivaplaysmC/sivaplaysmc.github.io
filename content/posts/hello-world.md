Finally doing this

## Hello, world

A blog is something that I always wanted to have.
The very idea of having a place in the internet for my thoughts to live is so fascinating.

Even if no one is going to read this, this blog will be my way of retrospection - hopefully I am a better person when I come back to this article some time in the future.

## My blogging journey

I have always had this bad habit of just [planning things and not doing them](#), and this blog is proof that I am changing for the better

### Reinventing the wheel with sveltekit

I love reinventing the wheel - there's always some learning in every single failed attempt.
Atleast it is more fun than reading the documentation tho.

Sometime in my first semester, I saw [Raxen001's amazing blog](https://raxen001.github.io/blog/) - it **just looked amazing** and it was my main motivation for starting a blog.

During the same time, I was also learning [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) (framework for sane people that want to retain their sanity), and like any neovim user who spends more time configuring it than actually using it, I started writing a blog with sveltekit. I was not unable to finish it - mdsvex was too hard to get right and mainly because I had a skill issue at anything frontend.

My sveltekit blog was not something that I tried once and left to rot - it was a collection of multiple failures which taught me something new and useful about sveltekit, or just web development everytime.

### Hugo

As of 12/10/2024, I use hugo to make this blog.

Hugo is super simple to get right. If you are more interested in having a block rather than learning web development, hugo is your answer.

Even if you are bad at frontend development, Hugo's got your back - there's a myriad of cool themes that you can make use of to have a painless setup.

You even get things for free like RSS feeder, comments, and many more - you only need to focus on your content
