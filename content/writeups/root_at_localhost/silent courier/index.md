## The statement

A mysterious file is being secretly transferred between servers. Your task is to intercept the transfer and uncover the hidden secret. Can you track it down before it's too late?

## Solution

File is analyzed using [apacket](https://apackets.com/).

The zip file is encrypted.
```terminal
$ unzip protected.zip
Archive:  protected.zip
[protected.zip] secret.zip password: %
```

Crack it with johntheripper
```terminal
$ zip2john protected.zip > zip.hash
